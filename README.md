Installation

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/mobile-operator-webapp.git
cd mobile-operator-webapp

Build the project

mvn clean install

Configuration

Database connection

Open src/main/resources/application.properties

Set the following properties to match your Oracle instance:

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@<HOST>:<PORT>:<SID>
spring.datasource.username=<DB_USERNAME>
spring.datasource.password=<DB_PASSWORD>
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

Security settings (optional)

Customize password encoding or roles in SecurityConfig.java

Database Setup and Creation Process

To prepare and initialize the Oracle database schema required by the application, follow these steps:

Create a dedicated database user/schema:

CREATE USER mobile_operator IDENTIFIED BY your_password;
GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO mobile_operator;

Execute DDL scripts:
In the db/scripts directory, you will find SQL files for creating tables, indexes, sequences, and constraints in the correct order:

01_create_tables.sql: defines all tables (e.g., customers, contracts, users, roles).

02_sequences.sql: creates sequences for primary keys.

03_constraints.sql: adds primary key, foreign key, and unique constraints.

04_views_and_synonyms.sql: sets up any views or synonyms for easier querying.

Run them in sequence using SQL*Plus or Oracle SQL Developer:

sqlplus mobile_operator/your_password@//<HOST>:<PORT>/<SERVICE>
SQL> @db/scripts/01_create_tables.sql
SQL> @db/scripts/02_sequences.sql
SQL> @db/scripts/03_constraints.sql
SQL> @db/scripts/04_views_and_synonyms.sql
SQL> EXIT

Load initial data (optional):
The script 05_seed_data.sql contains sample customers, contracts, and user/role entries to help you get started during development.

SQL> @db/scripts/05_seed_data.sql

Verify the schema:

Connect to the mobile_operator schema and run basic queries to confirm tables and relationships exist:

SELECT table_name FROM user_tables;
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM user_tab_columns WHERE table_name = 'CUSTOMERS';

Automated migrations (optional):
If you prefer Flyway or Liquibase, configure it in pom.xml and place migration scripts under src/main/resources/db/migration. Spring Boot will detect and run them on application startup.

Running the Application

mvn spring-boot:run

The application will start on http://localhost:8080 by default.

Usage

Register a new user (Customer role) or log in as Admin.

Customers can view and manage their contracts.

Admins can:

Manage all customers

Create, update, and delete contracts

View system reports and usage statistics

Testing

Run unit and integration tests with Maven:

mvn test
